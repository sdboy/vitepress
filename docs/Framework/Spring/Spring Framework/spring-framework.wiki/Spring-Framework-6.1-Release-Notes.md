## Upgrading From Spring Framework 6.0

### Baseline upgrades

Spring Framework 6.1 raises its minimum requirements with the following libraries:

* SnakeYAML 2.0
* Jackson 2.14
* Kotlin Coroutines 1.7
* Kotlin Serialization 1.5 

### Removed APIs

Several deprecated classes, constructors, and methods have been removed across the code base. See [29449](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/29449) and [30604](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30604).

### Parameter Name Retention

`LocalVariableTableParameterNameDiscoverer` has been removed in 6.1. Consequently, code within the Spring Framework and Spring portfolio frameworks no longer attempts to deduce parameter names by parsing bytecode. If you experience issues with dependency injection, property binding, SpEL expressions, or other use cases that depend on the names of parameters, you should compile your Java sources with the common Java 8+ `-parameters` flag for parameter name retention (instead of relying on the `-debug` compiler flag) in order to be compatible with `StandardReflectionParameterNameDiscoverer`. The Groovy compiler also supports a `-parameters` flag for the same purpose. With the Kotlin compiler, use the `-java-parameters` flag.

Maven users need to configure the `maven-compiler-plugin` for Java source code:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <parameters>true</parameters>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

Gradle users need to configure the `JavaCompile` task for Java source code, either with the Kotlin DSL:

```kotlin
tasks.withType<JavaCompile>() {
    options.compilerArgs.add("-parameters")
}
```

Or the Groovy DSL:

```groovy
tasks.withType(JavaCompile).configureEach {
    options.compilerArgs.add("-parameters")
}
```

Similarly, Gradle users need to configure the `GroovyCompile` task for Groovy source code, either with the Kotlin DSL:

```kotlin
tasks.withType<GroovyCompile>() {
    groovyOptions.parameters = true
}
```

Or the Groovy DSL:

```groovy
tasks.withType(GroovyCompile).configureEach {
    groovyOptions.parameters = true
}
```

Sometimes it is also necessary to manually configure your IDE.

In IntelliJ IDEA, open `Settings` and add `-parameters` to the following field.

- Build, Execution, Deployment &rarr; Compiler &rarr; Java Compiler &rarr; Additional command line parameters

In Eclipse IDE, open `Preferences` and activate the following checkbox.

- Java &rarr; Compiler &rarr; Store information about method parameters (usable via reflection)

In VSCode, edit or add the `.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs` file with the following content:

```properties
org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.codegen.methodParameters=generate
```

### Core Container

Aligned with the deprecation of `java.net.URL` constructors in JDK 20, `URL` resolution is now consistently performed via `URI`, including the handling of relative paths. This includes behavioral changes for uncommon cases such as when specifying a full URL as a relative path.
See [29481](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/29481) and [28522](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/28522).

`AutowireCapableBeanFactory.createBean(Class, int, boolean)` is deprecated now, in favor of the convention-based `createBean(Class)`. The latter is also consistently used internally in 6.1 – for example, in `SpringBeanJobFactory` for Quartz and `SpringBeanContainer` for Hibernate.

Array-to-collection conversion prefers a `List` result rather than a `Set` for a declared target type of `Collection`.

`ThreadPoolTaskExecutor` and `ThreadPoolTaskScheduler` enter a graceful shutdown phase when the application context starts to close. As a consequence, further task submissions are not accepted during stop or destroy callbacks in other components anymore. If the latter is necessary, switch the executor/scheduler's `acceptTasksAfterContextClose` flag to `true`, at the expense of a longer shutdown phase.

Message resolution through the `ApplicationContext` (accessing its internal `MessageSource`) is only allowed while the context is still active. After context close, `getMessage` attempts will throw an `IllegalStateException` now.

Spring's declarative caching infrastructure detects reactive method signatures, e.g. returning a Reactor `Mono` or `Flux`, and specifically processes such methods for asynchronous caching of their produced values rather than trying to cache the returned Reactive Streams `Publisher` instances themselves. This requires support in the target cache provider, e.g. with `CaffeineCacheManager` being set to `setAsyncCacheMode(true)`. For existing applications which rely on synchronous caching of custom `Mono.cache()`/`Flux.cache()` results, we recommend revising this towards 6.1-style caching of produced values; if such a revision is not immediately possible/desirable, you may set the system property "spring.cache.reactivestreams.ignore=true" (or put a similar entry into a `spring.properties` file on the classpath).

When building a native image, the verbose logging about pre-computed fields has been removed by default, and can be restored by passing `-Dspring.native.precompute.log=verbose` as a `native-image` compiler build argument to display related detailed logs.

### Data Access and Transactions

`@TransactionalEventListener` rejects invalid `@Transactional` usage on the same method: only allowed as `REQUIRES_NEW` (possibly in combination with `@Async`).

JPA bootstrapping now fails in case of an incomplete Hibernate Validator setup (e.g. without an EL provider), making such a scenario easier to debug.

Since `JpaTransactionManager` with `HibernateJpaDialect` translates commit/rollback exceptions to `DataAccessException` subclasses wherever possible, a Hibernate transaction exception formerly propagated as a generic `JpaSystemException` may show up as e.g. `CannotAcquireLockException` now. For a non-translatable fallback exception, `JpaSystemException` will be consistently thrown for commit/rollback now, instead of the former `TransactionSystemException` propagated from rollback.

JDBC `setNull` handling has been revised to bypass driver-level `getParameterType` resolution on PostgreSQL and MS SQL Server by default, as of [25679](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/25679) in 6.1.2. This is a performance optimization to avoid further roundtrips to the DBMS just for parameter type resolution which is known to make a significant difference on PostgreSQL and MS SQL Server specifically. If you happen to see a side effect e.g. for a [null byte array](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-relational/issues/1827), consider revising your SQL statement or your application-specified type information (e.g. through providing a `SqlParameterValue` instead of a plain `null` value). Otherwise, you may explicitly set the `spring.jdbc.getParameterType.ignore=false` flag as a system property (or in a `spring.properties` file in the root of the classpath) to restore full `getParameterType` resolution.

### Web Applications

Spring MVC and WebFlux now have built-in method validation support for controller method parameters with `@Constraint` annotations. To be in effect, you need to 1) opt out of AOP-based method validation by removing `@Validated` at the controller class level, 2) ensure `mvcValidator` or `webFluxValidator` beans are of type `jakarta.validation.Validator` (for example, `LocalValidatorFactoryBean`), and 3) have constraint annotations directly on method parameters. Where method validation is required (i.e. constraint annotations are present), model attribute and request body arguments with `@Valid` are also validated at the method level, and in that case no longer validated at the argument resolver level, thereby avoiding double validation. `BindingResult` arguments are still respected, but if not present or if method validation fails on other parameters, then a `MethodValidationException` raised. That's not handled yet in 6.1 M1, but will be in M2 with [30644](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30644). See [29825](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/29825) for more details on the support in M1, and also the umbrella issue [30645](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30645) for all other related tasks and for providing feedback.

The format for `MethodArgumentNotValidException` and `WebExchangeBindException` message arguments has changed. Errors are now joined with `", and "`, without single quotes and brackets. Field errors are resolved through the `MessageSource` with nothing further such as the field name added. This gives applications full control over the error format by customizing individual error codes. See [30198](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30198) and also planned documentation improvement [30653](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30653).

The default order of mappings has been refined to be more consistent by changing `RouterFunctionMapping` order from `3` to `-1` in Spring MVC. That means `RouterFunctionMapping` is now always ordered before `RequestMappingHandlerMapping` in both Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux. See [30278](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30278) for more details.

The `throwExceptionIfNoHandlerFound` property of `DispatcherHandler` is now set to `true` by default and is deprecated. The resulting exception is handled by default as a 404 error so it should result in the same outcome. Likewise, `ResourceHttpRequestHandler` now raises `NoResourceFoundException`, which is also handled by default as a 404, and should have the same outcome for most applications. See [29491](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/29491).

`@RequestParam`, `@RequestHeader`, and other controller method argument annotations now use the defaultValue if the input is a non-empty String without text.

`ResponseBodyEmitter` now completes the response if the exception is not an `IOException`, see issue [30687](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30687).

Preflight checks are now executed at the start of the `HandlerInteceptor` chain and not at the end.

The [HTTP interface client](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/rest-clients.html#rest-http-interface) no longer enforces a 5 second default timeout on methods with a blocking signature, instead relying on default timeout and configuration settings of the underlying HTTP client. See [30248](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30248).

The HTTP server Observability instrumentation in WebFlux was limited and was not properly observing errors. As a result, the WebFlux `ServerHttpObservationFilter` is now deprecated in favor of direct instrumentation on the `WebHttpHandlerBuilder`. See [30013](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30013).

`ReactorResourceFactory` class has been moved from the `org.springframework.http.client.reactive` package to the `org.springframework.http.client` one.

To reduce memory usage in `RestClient` and `RestTemplate`, most `ClientHttpRequestFactory` implementations no longer buffer request bodies before sending them to the server.
As a result, for certain content types such as JSON, the contents size is no longer known, and a `Content-Length` header is no longer set.
If you would like to buffer request bodies like before, simply wrap the `ClientHttpRequestFactory` you are using in a `BufferingClientHttpRequestFactory`.

Jackson [`ParameterNamesModule`](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/tree/2.17/parameter-names) is now part of the well-known modules automatically registered by `Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder` when present in the classpath. This can introduce changes of behavior in JSON serialization/deserialization as mentioned in the module documentation linked above. In such case, additional `@JsonCreator` or `@JsonProperty("propertyName")` annotations may be required. If you prefer avoid enabling such module, it is possible to use `Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder#modules` in order to disable automatic module registration.

`ReactorClientHttpConnector` now implements `SmartLifecycle` to provide lifecycle management capabilities. As a consequence, it now requires `spring-context` dependency.

### Messaging Applications

The [RSocket interface client](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/rsocket.html#rsocket-interface) no longer enforces a 5 second default timeout on methods with a blocking signature, instead relying on default timeout and configuration settings of the RSocket client, and the underlying RSocket transport. See [30248](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30248).

In an effort to reduce the potential for security vulnerabilities in the Spring Expression Language (SpEL) to adversely affect Spring applications, the team has decided to disable support for evaluating SpEL expressions from untrusted sources by default. Within the core Spring Framework, this applies to the SpEL-based `selector` header support in WebSocket messaging, specifically in the `DefaultSubscriptionRegistry`. The `selector` header support will remain in place but will have to be explicitly enabled beginning with Spring Framework 6.1 (see [30550](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30550)). For example, a custom implementation of `WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer` can override the `configureMessageBroker()` method and configure the selector header name as follows: `registry.enableSimpleBroker().setSelectorHeaderName("selector");`.

### Testing

By default, if an error is encountered during build-time AOT processing, an exception will be thrown, and the overall process will fail immediately. If you would prefer that build-time AOT processing continue after errors are encountered, you can disable the `failOnError` mode which results in errors being logged at `WARN` level or with greater detail at `DEBUG` level. The `failOnError` mode can be disabled from the command line or a build script by setting a JVM system property named `spring.test.aot.processing.failOnError` to `false`. As an alternative, you can set the same property via the `SpringProperties` mechanism.

## New and Noteworthy

### Core Container

* [General compatibility with virtual threads](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/23443) and JDK 21 overall.
* Configuration options for virtual threads: a dedicated [VirtualThreadTaskExecutor](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/6.1.0-SNAPSHOT/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/task/VirtualThreadTaskExecutor.html) and a [virtual threads mode on SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/6.1.0-SNAPSHOT/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/task/SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor.html#setVirtualThreads(boolean)), plus an analogous [SimpleAsyncTaskScheduler](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/6.1.0-SNAPSHOT/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/concurrent/SimpleAsyncTaskScheduler.html) with a new-thread-per-task strategy and a virtual threads mode.
* Lifecycle integration with Project CRaC for JVM checkpoint restore (see [related documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/6.1/integration/checkpoint-restore.html)), including a `-Dspring.context.checkpoint=onRefresh` option.
* Lifecycle integrated [pause/resume capability](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30831) and [parallel graceful shutdown](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/27090) for `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor` and `ThreadPoolTaskScheduler` as well as `SimpleAsyncTaskScheduler`.
* A `-Dspring.context.exit=onRefresh` option is available with AppCDS training runs as the main use-case; see [31595](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/31595).
* Reachability metadata contribution improvements, preparing for upcoming GraalVM changes: missing reachability metadata will be soon reported as runtime exceptions for better developer experience; see [31213](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/31213).
* New `ModuleResource`: `Resource` implementation for `java.lang.Module` resolution, performing `getInputStream()` access via `Module.getResourceAsStream`.
* Custom `@Component` stereotype annotations may now use `@AliasFor` to configure an annotation attribute override for the component's name. Consequently, the name of the annotation attribute that is used to specify the bean name is no longer required to be `value`, and custom stereotype annotations can now declare an attribute with a different name (such as `name`) and annotate that attribute with `@AliasFor(annotation = Component.class, attribute = "value")`.
* Convention-based `@Component` stereotype names based on the `value` attribute are now deprecated in favor of explicit `@AliasFor` declarations. See previous bullet point.
* Spring now finds all `@ComponentScan` and `@PropertySource` annotations; see [30941](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30941).
* Async/reactive destroy methods – for example, on R2DBC `ConnectionFactory`; see [26691](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/26991).
* Async/reactive cacheable methods, including corresponding support in the `Cache` interface and in `CaffeineCacheManager`; see [17559](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/17559) and [17920](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/17920).
* Reactive `@Scheduled` methods (including Kotlin coroutines); see [22924](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/pull/29924).
* Selecting a specific target scheduler for each `@Scheduled` method; see [20818](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/20818).
* `@Scheduled` methods for one-time tasks (with just an initial delay); see [31211](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/31211).
* Observation instrumentation of `@Scheduled` methods; see [29883](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/29883).
* Spring Framework will not produce observations out-of-the-box for `@Async` or `@EventListener` annotated methods, but will help you with propagating context (e.g. MDC logging with the current trace id) for the execution of those methods. See the new `ContextPropagatingTaskDecorator`, the [relevant reference documentation section](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/6.1/integration/observability.html#observability.application-events), and [issue 31130](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/31130).
* `Validator` factory methods for programmatic validator implementations; see [29890](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/pull/29890).
* `Validator.validateObject(Object)` with returned `Errors` and `Errors.failOnError` method for flexible programmatic usage; see [19877](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/19877).
* `MethodValidationInterceptor` throws `MethodValidationException` subclass of `ConstraintViolationException` with violations adapted to `MessageSource` resolvable codes, and to `Errors` instances for `@Valid` arguments with cascaded violations; see [29825](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/29825) and umbrella issue [30645](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30645).
* Support for resource patterns in `@PropertySource`; see [21325](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/21325).
* Support for `Iterable` and `MultiValueMap` binding in `BeanWrapper` and `DirectFieldAccessor`; see [907](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/pull/907) and [26297](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/26297).
* Revised `Instant` and `Duration` parsing (aligned with Spring Boot); see [22013](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/22013).
* Spring AOP now supports Kotlin Coroutines; see [22462](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/22462).
* `ControlFlowPointcut` has been revised to make its internals more open to extension by subclasses.
* `ControlFlowPointcut` now provides built-in pattern matching support for method names, analogous to the pattern matching support in `NameMatchMethodPointcut`. Users can provide one or more method name patterns when constructing a `ControlFlowPointcut`. Alternatively, subclasses can override one of the new protected `isMatch(...)` methods – for example, to support regular expressions instead of simple pattern matching.
* New `getMergedRepeatableAnnotationAttributes()` method in `AnnotatedTypeMetadata` that provides dedicated support for finding merged repeatable annotation attributes with full `@AliasFor` semantics.

### Spring Expression Language (SpEL)

* Numerous improvements to the SpEL [Language Reference](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/language-ref.html), including but not limited to:
  * Supported letters in variable names
  * Limitation regarding minimum values for numeric literals
  * Safe navigation support for selection and projection
  * Safe navigation semantics within compound expressions
  * Official documentation of the power operator, custom overloading operators, `between` operator, increment and decrement operators, as well as the repeat and character subtraction operators for strings
* Numerous bug fixes.
* Improved support for constructor and method invocations that use varargs.
* The maximum length of a SpEL expression used in an `ApplicationContext` is now configurable via the `spring.context.expression.maxLength` Spring property.
* Support for letters other than A-Z in property/field/variable names in SpEL expressions; see [30580](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30580). 
* Support for registering a `MethodHandle` as a SpEL function; see [related documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/6.1/core/expressions/language-ref/functions.html).

### Data Access and Transactions

* Common `TransactionExecutionListener` contract with `beforeBegin`/`afterBegin`, `beforeCommit`/`afterCommit` and `beforeRollback`/`afterRollback` callbacks triggered by the transaction manager (for thread-bound as well as reactive transactions); see [27479](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/27479).
* `@TransactionalEventListener` and `TransactionalApplicationListener` always run in the original thread, independent from an async multicaster setup; see [30244](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30244).
* `@TransactionalEventListener` and `TransactionalApplicationListener` can participate in reactive transactions when the `ApplicationEvent` gets published with the transaction context as its event source; see [27515](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/27515).
* A failed `CompletableFuture` triggers a rollback for an async transactional method; see [30018](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30018).
* `DataAccessUtils` provides various `optionalResult` methods with a `java.util.Optional` return type; see [27735](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/pull/27735).
* The new `JdbcClient` provides a unified facade for query/update statements on top of `JdbcTemplate` and `NamedParameterJdbcTemplate`, with flexible parameter options as well as flexible result retrieval options; see [30931](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30931). 
* `SimplePropertyRowMapper` and `SimplePropertySqlParameterSource` strategies for use with `JdbcTemplate`/`NamedParameterJdbcTemplate` as well as `JdbcClient`, providing flexible constructor/property/field mapping for result objects and named parameter holders; see [26594](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/26594#issuecomment-1678725276).
* `SimpleJdbcInsert` now provides support for _quoted identifiers_ which can be enabled via the new `usingQuotedIdentifiers()` builder method.
* `SQLExceptionSubclassTranslator` can be configured with an overriding `customTranslator`; see [24634](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/24634).
* The R2DBC `DatabaseClient` provides `bindValues(Map)` for a pre-composed map of parameter values and `bindProperties(Object)` for parameter objects based on bean properties or record components; see [27282](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/27282).
* The R2DBC `DatabaseClient` provides `mapValue(Class)` for plain database column values and `mapProperties(Class)` for result objects based on bean properties or record components; see [26021](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/26021).
* `BeanPropertyRowMapper` and `DataClassRowMapper` available for R2DBC as well; see [30530](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/pull/30530).
* `JpaTransactionManager` with `HibernateJpaDialect` translates Hibernate commit/rollback exceptions to `DataAccessException` subclasses wherever possible, e.g. to `CannotAcquireLockException`, aligned with the exception hierarchy thrown from persistence exception translation for repository operations; see [31274](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/31274) for the primary motivation.

### Web Applications

* Spring MVC and WebFlux now have built-in method validation support for controller method parameters with `@Constraint` annotations. That means you no longer need `@Validated` at the controller class level to enable method validation via an AOP proxy. Built-in method validation is layered on top of the existing argument validation for model attribute and request body arguments. The two are more tightly integrated and coordinated, e.g. avoiding cases with double validation. See the [upgrade notes](#web-applications) for migration details and umbrella issue [30645](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30645) for all related tasks and feedback.
* Method validation is supported with method parameters that are collections, arrays, or maps of objects.
* The `HandlerMethodValidationException` raised by the new built-in method validation exposes a `Visitor` API to process validation errors by controller method parameter type, e.g. `@RequestParameter`, `@PathVariable`, etc. 
* `MethodValidationInterceptor` supports validation of `Mono` and `Flux` method parameters; see issue [20781](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/20781).
* Spring MVC raises `NoHandlerFoundException` by default if there is no matching handler or `ResponseStatusException(NOT_FOUND)` if there is no matching static resource, and also handles these with the aim of consistent handling for 404 errors out of the box, including RFC 7807 responses; see [29491](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/29491).
* [ErrorResponse](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/6.1.0-SNAPSHOT/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/ErrorResponse.html) allows [customization](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/6.1/web/webmvc/mvc-ann-rest-exceptions.html#mvc-ann-rest-exceptions-i18n) of `ProblemDetail` type via `MessageSource` and use of custom `ProblemDetail` through its builder.
* Spring MVC resets the Servlet response buffer prior to handling an error and rendering an error response. 
* `DataBinder` now supports [constructor binding](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/6.1-SNAPSHOT/core/validation/beans-beans.html#beans-constructor-binding) where argument values are looked up through a `NameResolver` (e.g. in the HTTP request parameters map), and those lookups can be customized through an `@BindParam` annotation. This also supports nested object structures through the invocation of constructors necessary to initialize constructor parameters. The feature is integrated in the data binding of Spring MVC and WebFlux and provides a safer option for data binding of expected parameters only; see [Model Design](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/6.1-SNAPSHOT/web/webflux/controller/ann-initbinder.html) for more details.
Spring MVC and WebFlux now support data binding via constructors, including nested objects constructors
* `@ControllerAdvice` and `@RestControllerAdvice` can now specify custom component names via their new `name` attributes.
* WebFlux provides an option for blocking execution of controller methods with synchronous signatures on a different `Executor` such as the `VirtualThreadTaskExecutor`; see [Blocking Execution](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/6.1-SNAPSHOT/web/webflux/config.html#webflux-config-blocking-execution) in the reference documentation.
* `SseEmitter` now formats data with newlines according to the SSE format.
* New `RestClient`, a synchronous HTTP client that offers an API similar to `WebClient`, but sharing infrastructure with the `RestTemplate`; see [29552](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/29552).
* Jetty-based `ClientHttpRequestFactory` for use with `RestTemplate` and `RestClient`; see [30564](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30564).
* JDK HttpClient-based `ClientHttpRequestFactory` for use with `RestTemplate` and `RestClient`; see [30478](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/pull/30478).
* Reactor Netty-based `ClientHttpRequestFactory` for use with `RestTemplate` and `RestClient`; see [30835](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30835).
* Improved buffering in various `ClientHttpRequestFactory` implementations; see [30557](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30557).
* [HTTP Interface client](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/rest-clients.html#rest-http-interface) with built-in adapters for the new `RestClient` and `RestTemplate` in addition to the existing adapter for the reactive `WebClient`. 
* HTTP Interface client supports `MultipartFile` as an input method parameter.
* HTTP Interface client supports `UriBuilderFactory` as an input method parameter to use instead of the one the underlying client is configured with – for example, if it's necessary to vary the `baseUri` dynamically.
* The `@HttpExchange` annotation used on HTTP interface methods is now supported for server-side handling in Spring MVC and WebFlux as an alternative to `@RequestMapping`; see [@HttpExchange](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/6.1-SNAPSHOT/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-requestmapping.html#mvc-ann-httpexchange-annotation) for more details and guidance.
* JVM checkpoint restore support added to Reactor Netty-based `ClientHttpRequestFactory` for use with `RestTemplate` and `RestClient` and to `ClientHttpConnector` for use with `WebClient`; see [31280](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/31280), [31281](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/31281), and [31180](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/31180).
* General Coroutines support revision in WebFlux, which includes [`CoroutineContext` propagation in `CoWebFilter`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/27522), [`CoroutineContext` propagation in `coRouter` DSL with `filter`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/26977), [a new `context` function in `coRouter` DSL](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/27010), [support for `@ModelAttribute` with suspending function in WebFlux](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30894), and [consistent usage of the `Mono` variant of `awaitSingle()`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/31127).
* Support for Kotlin parameter default and optional values in HTTP handler methods; see [21139](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/21139) and [29820](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/29820).

### Messaging Applications

* STOMP messaging supports a new `preserveReceiveOrder` config option for ordered processing of messages received from a given client. That's in addition to the existing `preservePublishOrder` flag for messages published to clients; see the [Order of Messages](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/6.1/web/websocket/stomp/ordered-messages.html) section of the reference docs.
* The `@RSocketExchange` annotation used on RSocket interface methods is now supported for responder-side handling as an alternative to `@MessageMapping`; see [@RSocketExchange](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/6.1-SNAPSHOT/rsocket.html#rsocket-annot-rsocketexchange) for more details and guidance.
* Interface parameter annotations are detected for messaging handler methods as well (analogous to web handler methods).
* The SpEL-based `selector` header support in WebSocket messaging is now disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled; see [30550](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30550) and the [upgrade notes](#messaging-applications) for migration details.
* Observability support for JMS: Spring Framework now produces observations when publishing messages with `JmsTemplate` and when processing messages with `MessageListener` or `@JmsListener`; see [the reference docs section](ttps://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/6.1/integration/observability.html#observability.jms) and issue [30335](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30335).

### Testing

* `ApplicationContext` failure threshold support: avoids repeated attempts to load a failing `ApplicationContext` in the TestContext framework, based on a failure threshold which defaults to 1 but can be configured via a system property; see [related documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/6.1/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/failure-threshold.html).
* `@⁠SpringJUnitConfig` and `@⁠SpringJUnitWebConfig` now declare `loader` attributes that support custom `ContextLoader` configuration.
* A `ContextCustomizerFactory` can now be registered for a particular test class via the new `@ContextCustomizerFactories` annotation.
* Numerous enhancments for `@TestPropertySource`:
  * Support for resource patterns (i.e., wildcards) in `locations`.
  * Multiple inlined properties can be supplied via a single text block.
  * Property file encoding can be configured via the new `encoding` attribute.
  * A custom `PropertySourceFactory` can be configured via the new `factory` attribute in order to support custom property file formats such as JSON, YAML, etc.
* Support for recording asynchronous events with `@RecordApplicationEvents`; see [30020](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/pull/30020).
  * Record events from threads other than the main test thread.
  * Assert events from a separate thread – for example with Awaitility.
* When used with JUnit Jupiter, `@​BeforeTransaction` and `@​AfterTransaction` methods can now make use of parameter injection to have Spring components (such as an `@Autowired DataSource`) injected directly into the method.
* `JdbcTestUtils` has new overloaded methods that accept a `JdbcClient` instead of `JdbcOperations`.
* MockMvc now supports initialization of filters with init parameters and mapping to specific dispatch types.
* `MockMvcWebTestClient` now supports the `RequestPostProcessor` hook which can, for example, allow varying user identity across tests; see [31298](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/31298).
* `MockRestServiceServer` supports the new `RestClient` in addition to the `RestTemplate`.
* Support for `null` in `MockHttpServletResponse.setCharacterEncoding()`; see [30341](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30341).
* Errors encountered during build-time AOT processing now cause the build to fail immediately. This behavior can be disabled by setting the `spring.test.aot.processing.failOnError` property to `false`. See the [upgrade notes](#testing) for migration details.
* New `@⁠DisabledInAotMode` annotation that can be used to disable AOT build-time processing of a test's `ApplicationContext` and to disable an entire test class or a single test method at run time when the test suite is run with AOT optimizations enabled.
* `@Resource` may now be used for dependency injection in test classes when running in AOT mode.
