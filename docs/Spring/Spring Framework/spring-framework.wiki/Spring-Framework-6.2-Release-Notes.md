## Upgrading From Spring Framework 6.1

### Baseline Upgrades

Spring Framework 6.2 raises its minimum requirements with the following libraries:

* For GraalVM native image support only, Hibernate 6.5
* FreeMarker 2.3.33
* HtmlUnit 4.2
* Codecs and converters now officially support Protobuf 4.x, raising our baseline to Protobuf 3.29.

We also recommend an upgrade to Jackson 2.18 while preserving runtime compatibility with Jackson 2.15+ for the time being.

### Removed APIs

Several deprecated classes, constructors, and methods have been removed across the code base. See [30608](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30608), [31492](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/31492), and [33123](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/33123).

### Core Container

6.2 comes with a slightly revised autowiring algorithm where among a set of candidate beans that match by type, parameter name matches and `@Qualifier("...")` matches (against the target bean name) overrule `@jakarta.annotation.Priority` ranking whereas they were previously checked the other way around. That said, since we do not recommend mixing and matching those qualification mechanisms and generally do not recommend `@Priority` for identifying single candidates (rather just for ranking multiple candidates in an injected collection), we do not expect common regressions here. Note that `@Primary` beans always come first (and as a side note, 6.2 introduces the notion of `@Fallback` beans as well).

The core container will now consistently reject invalid `@Configuration` class setups, For example:
* a `@Bean` method that declares a `void` return type
* a `@Bean` method that is also annotated with `@Autowired`

6.2 also comes with deeper generic type matching. If an injection point that previously matched does not match anymore, double-check your generic signatures at that injection point (e.g. your constructor argument) and for the bean type on the bean definition (e.g. the return type of your `@Bean` method). Spring is effectively less lenient in accepting fallback matches now, insisting on the resolvable part of the type signature to match even if the remaining part is leniently accepted with unresolvable type variables or wildcards.

Component scanning happens early in the `BeanFactory` initialization and, as such, is not suitable to be guarded by a condition that is evaluated late. We now fail hard if you use `@ComponentScan` with a `REGISTER_BEAN` condition (such as Spring Boot's `@ConditionalOnBean`).

We've made it clearer that bean definition overriding is discouraged in production code, and the container now logs each override at `INFO` level. While not recommended, you can silence those logs by setting the `allowBeanDefinitionOverriding` flag to `true` on the bean factory or application context before it is refreshed.

### Property Placeholder Resolution

The parser for property placeholders has been completely rewritten to be as lenient as possible.
As a result, certain constructs that previously worked by accident rather than by design are no longer possible.

A typical placeholder can be described as `${key:default}` where `default` is evaluated if `key` is not present.
Placeholder keys that have the `:` character in them need to be escaped if a literal resolution is expected.

For instance, if a property source can resolve `sub://host` to `example.com`, the placeholder should be written as `${sub\://host}` (assuming `\` being configured as the escape character).
Note that the backslash must be doubled in configuration properties:

```properties
my.host=${sub\\://host}
```

If you can control the keys, we strongly encourage you to migrate to a format where `:` isn't used as part of the key.

As of 6.2, the placeholder can also be escaped, e.g. `This is a \\${test}!` evaluates to `This is ${test}!` in case you need to use the placeholder syntax literally. If you used the escaped character right before the placeholder, you will need to modify your configuration structure to move `\\` in the value itself.

### Spring Expression Language (SpEL)

`PropertyAccessor` implementations that specify target types for which they should apply now properly take precedence over generic, fallback property accessors such as the `ReflectivePropertyAccessor`. Consequently, the order in which accessors are evaluated may change when upgrading to Spring Framework 6.2. If you notice unexpected behavior for property access in SpEL expressions, you may need to revise the `canRead()` and `canWrite()` implementations of the property accessors used in your application or register accessors in a different order.

### HTTP clients

The behavior of the  `RestClient` API has been changed to better align with other clients and to fix observability issues.
Previously, writing the following would "fire and forget" an HTTP request and would leave observation scopes hanging:

```java
ResponseSpec spec = restClient.get().uri("/spring").retrieve();
```

As of 6.2, this is now a no-op and applications must invoke a terminal operation on the `ResponseSpec` to have any side effect. For the previous case, developers will need to update their code to:

```java
ResponseEntity<Void> response = restClient.get().uri("/spring").retrieve().toBodilessEntity();
```

### Web Applications

Static resource locations configured as a String now have a  trailing slash appended if not present. This is necessary because otherwise the path segment after the last slash is dropped when appending the request path with `Resource#createRelative`. This does not apply to static resource locations configured as a `Resource`.

`org.webjars:webjars-locator-core` support implemented in `WebJarsResourceResolver` is deprecated due to efficiency issues as of Spring Framework 6.2 and is superseded by `org.webjars:webjars-locator-lite` support implemented in `LiteWebJarsResourceResolver`.

### Messaging Applications

The JMS `DefaultMessageListenerContainer` comes with revised `idleReceivesPerTaskLimit` semantics when using its default executor: Core threads always stay alive now, with only surplus consumers (between `concurrentConsumers` and `maxConcurrentConsumers`) timing out after the specified number of idle receives. Only in combination with a `maxMessagesPerTask` does `idleReceivesPerTaskLimit` have an effect on core consumers as well, as inferred for an external thread pool for dynamic rescheduling of all consumer tasks.

STOMP over WebSocket configuration now orders components it declares at 0 in order to be ahead of Boot's WebServerStartStopLifecycle default phase. See [#27519](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/27519)


### Testing

Support for HtmlUnit has moved to a new major release that requires some changes when upgrading, see [Migrating from HtmlUnit 2.x.x to HtmlUnit 3.x.x](https://htmlunit.sourceforge.io/migration.html) for additional details. If you are using HtmlUnit with Selenium, please note that the coordinates of the driver have changed, and the version now matches the Selenium version: `org.seleniumhq.selenium:htmlunit3-driver:X.Y.Z`, where `X.Y.Z` is your Selenium version.


## New and Noteworthy

### Support for escaping property placeholders
Property placeholders are a way to replace a property from the environment in an arbitrary String.
Assuming that `customer.name` is set to `"John Smith"` in the `Environment`, `"Customer ${customer.name}"` would resolve to `"Customer John Smith"`.
There are corner cases where you’d like to retain the original value rather than having it resolved.
Spring Framework 6.2 allows you to escape a placeholder using a configurable escape character (backslash by default).
Taking our previous example, `"Customer \${customer.name}"` resolves now to  `"Customer ${customer.name}"`.

Note that the backslash must be doubled in configuration properties.

The escaping applies to the separator as well, see the "Property Placeholder Resolution" section above.

### Support for fallback beans

A fallback bean is used if no bean of that type has been provided.
This is essentially a companion of `@Primary` without the trade-off of having to specify it.
Consider that a component requires `MyService` to be defined.
You can provide a default implementation for the service, but you’d like that if a user specifies one, it can be injected by type transparently.
So far, the user had to configure their specific bean with `@Primary` to make sure it is used, since two beans of that type are defined now.

As of Spring Framework 6.2.0 you can craft your configuration with `@Fallback`:

```java
@Configuration
class MyConfiguration {

	@Bean
	MyComponent myComponent(MyService service) {
    	//...
	}

	@Bean
	@Fallback
	MyService defaultMyService() {
    	//...
	}

}
```

If no other `MyService` bean is defined, `defaultMyService` is used.
Otherwise, the container will pick transparently the one that’s been defined externally.

[See the dedicated section in the reference documentation.](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/autowired-qualifiers.html)

### Background bean initialization

Individual beans can be initialized in the background using the newly introduced bootstrap attribute.

```java
@Configuration
class MyConfiguration {

    @Bean(bootstrap = BACKGROUND)
    MyExpensiveComponent myComponent() {
   	 ...
    }

}
```

[Check the reference guide for more details about this new feature](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/6.2/core/beans/java/composing-configuration-classes.html#beans-java-startup-background).

### Enhanced indexing support in SpEL

The Spring Expression Language (SpEL) now offers first-class support for indexing into custom structures via new `IndexAccessor` and `CompilableIndexAccessor` SPIs plus a built-in `ReflectiveIndexAccessor` implementation of those SPIs (see [reference documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/6.2/core/expressions/language-ref/properties-arrays.html#expressions-indexing-custom)), and SpEL now provides safe navigation support for indexing into arrays, collections, strings, maps, objects, and custom structures (see [reference documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/6.2/core/expressions/language-ref/operator-safe-navigation.html#expressions-operator-safe-navigation-indexing)). Furthermore, the documentation for SpEL's property navigation and indexing support has been fully revised along with official documentation for indexing into strings and objects in SpEL expressions.

### Bean overriding in tests, `@TestBean`, `@MockitoBean`, and `@MockitoSpyBean`

[See our new reference documentation section on these features](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/6.2/testing/testcontext-framework/bean-overriding.html)
and [the dedicated blog post](https://spring.io/blog/2024/04/16/spring-framework-6-2-0-m1-overriding-beans-in-tests) published during the milestones phase.

### AssertJ support for MockMvc

We love AssertJ! While Spring Boot has already jumped on that train a while ago and provides several testing facilities using it, the framework team has been more conservative. At the same time, we recognize that our Hamcrest support may not fit everyone’s needs: the use of static imports make the API less discoverable and writing custom assertions is harder.
Spring Framework now provides an exhaustive support for testing your web application with MockMvc and AssertJ.

Building an `MvcTester` instance is more straightforward, with dedicated factory methods on the class itself.
If you have a `WebApplicationContext` handy, this is as easy as `MvcTester.from(webApplicationContext)`.
If you want to test only a controller in a unit test, you can do so as follows:

```java
MvcTester mvc = MvcTester.of(List.of(new HelloController()), builder ->
builder.defaultRequest(get("/hello").accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)).build());
```

Once you have an instance you can perform your usual requests and wrap that in AssertJ’s standard assertThat:

```java
assertThat(mvc.perform(get("/vehicle/{id}", "12").accept(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)))
        .hasStatusOk()
        .body().isEqualTo("Honda Civic");
```

This covers the same features as the existing Hamcrest matchers, and extends it with advanced JSON support, for instance:

```java
assertThat(mvc.perform(get("/message")))
        .body().json()
        .isLenientlyEqualTo(new ClassPathResource("samples/message.json"));

```

[See the reference documentation for more on that](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/6.2/testing/mockmvc/assertj.html).

### Dynamic properties can now be registered from within a test's `ApplicationContext`

You can now register dynamic properties in tests by contributing `DynamicPropertyRegistrar` beans to the context.

[See related documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/6.2/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/dynamic-property-sources.html).

### Constructor Data Binding to Lists, Maps, and Arrays

While setter binding is driven by request values, and may need to  be restricted through allow and disallow lists, constructor binding is driven by the constructor arguments that already declare exactly and only what is expected. In 6.2 constructor binding has been enhanced to support List, Map, and array arguments giving it parity with setter binding. 

See [#32426](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/32426)


### Data Binding from Headers

In addition to Servlet request parameters, multiparts, and path variables, data binding now also supports binding request header values to `@ModelAttribute` controller method parameters.

See [#32676](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/32676).


### Fragment Rendering

Spring MVC and WebFlux support rendering multiple views in one request, or to create a stream of rendered views. This helps to support HTML-over-the-wire libraries such as htmx.org and @hotwired/turbo. 

See [HTML Fragments](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc-view/mvc-fragments.html) in the reference documentation.


### Content negotiation for `@ExceptionHandler` methods

`@ExceptionHandler` methods now [support content negotiation during error handling](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/31936). It allows selecting a content type for error responses depending on what the client requested.

Here's a code snippet showing this feature in action:

```java
@ExceptionHandler(produces = "application/json")
public ResponseEntity<ErrorMessage> handleJson(IllegalArgumentException exc) {
    return ResponseEntity.badRequest().body(new ErrorMessage(exc.getMessage(), 42));
}

@ExceptionHandler(produces = "text/html")
public String handle(IllegalArgumentException exc, Model model) {
    model.addAttribute("error", new ErrorMessage(exc.getMessage(), 42));
    return "errorView";
}
```

Here, automated clients will get a JSON response, while browsers will display an HTML error page with custom messages.


### URL Parsing

Two new URL parser implementations replace the regular expression based parsing that led to vulnerability reports such as [CVE-2024-22262](https://spring.io/security/cve-2024-22262) and others after it. The parser implementation used by default follows closely RFC 3986 syntax, in effect expecting URL's to be well formed. The other parser follows the [URL Living URL standard](https://url.spec.whatwg.org), and provides lenient handling of a wide range of user typed URL's, which allows parsing URL's in the same way that browsers do, and is important in scenarios where a server application parses a user provided URL that is then returned to and may be used by a browser (e.g. redirect or as a link in HTML). See [URI Parsing](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-uri-building.html#uri-parsing) in the reference documentation.


```java
// This is using the "strict" RFC parser
UriComponents uriComponents = UriComponentsBuilder.fromUriString(uri, ParserType.RFC).build();
// Using the "living URL" standard is more flexible and behaves similarly to browsers
UriComponents uriComponents = UriComponentsBuilder.fromUriString(uri, ParserType.WHAT_WG).build();
```

### `UrlHandlerFilter` for trailing slash match

Spring Framework recently deprecated the trailing slash match option in `PathMatchConfigurer`, the Spring community requested a way to gracefully handle this transition period in large applications.
The new `UrlHandlerFilter` Servlet and reactive filters will help redirecting or rewriting incoming URLs with a trailing slash `"/blog/blog-title/"` to `"/blog/blog-title"`.

[Check out the reference documentation for this](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/filters.html#filters.url-handler).


### Easier reflection hint registration for Native apps

We have significantly improved the developer experience of registering reflection hints.
`@RegisterReflection` has been introduced to easily register hints against arbitrary data types,
and `@ReflectionScan` lets you opt-in for scanning of any reflection hints on arbitrary classes, not only Spring beans.
See [the reference documentation section for this](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/6.2/core/aot.html#aot.hints.reflective).

### Other

Apart from the changes listed above, there have also been a lot of minor tweaks, improvements, and bug fixes including:

* This release includes a revision of the autowiring algorithm – for example, for consistent generic type matching and for faster resolution of name-based matches. See [#28122](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/28122) and [#17677](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/17677).
* `TaskDecorator` support for scheduled tasks; `TaskDecorator` is used for scheduled tasks as well, harmonizing task execution and scheduling in the process. See [#23755](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/23755).
* The [`Task` and `ScheduledTask` types now expose metadata about their execution](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/24560): last execution time and outcome, next scheduled execution time, etc.
* `@DurationFormat` and `@Scheduled` now support "simple" duration formats such as "30s" or "2h30m".
* Improved Spring Expression Language (SpEL) compilation support for constructor and method invocations that use varargs as well as for expressions that index into arrays and lists with an `Integer`. In addition, methods in SpEL expressions are now invoked via a public interface or public superclass whenever possible.
* Interception mechanism for RFC 7807 error detail responses [#31970](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/pull/31970)
* `ResponseBodyEmitter` now [allows the registration of multiple state listeners](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/33356), which is useful if your application maintains an ad hoc "keep alive" mechanism for your streaming sessions.
* `ServerResponse` now provides [more ways to send data streams for WebMvc functional endpoints](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/32710). Although Server Sent Events were already supported, this enables support for other streaming protocols.
* The [new CHIPS feature deployed by browser vendors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Privacy_sandbox/Partitioned_cookies) requires changes in applications using third-party cookies. Reactive web servers (except Undertow) now [support Partitioned cookies](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/31454).
* You can now test WebMvc.fn endpoints with `MockMvcWebTestClient`, just as you could already for your annotated controllers. See [#30477](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30477).
